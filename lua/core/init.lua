require("core.base")        -- Basic setup: leader, termguicolors (first, as everything depends on leader)
require("core.options")     -- Global options (after base, before keymaps/plugins)
require("core.lazy")        -- Plugin manager setup (after options, as some opts like rtp are set here; plugins load lazily)
require("core.autocommands") -- Autocommands (early, but after options/lazy; handles highlights, statusline, etc.)
require("core.keymaps")     -- Core keymaps (after base/options for leader/opts; before specialized ones)
-- require("core.buffers")     -- Buffer management keymaps/functions (builds on core keymaps)
require("core.ui")          -- UI keymaps and highlights (after options)
require("core.stuff")       -- Miscellaneous keymaps (e.g., git, fzf; after core)
require("core.yank")        -- Yank functions and keymaps (after core keymaps)
require("core.search")      -- Search functions and keymaps (after core)
require("core.quickfix")    -- Quickfix keymaps and functions (last among keymap modules, as it may interact with searches)
